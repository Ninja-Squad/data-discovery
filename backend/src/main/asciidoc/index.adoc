== Introduction

This document describes the URLs, parameters, request and response bodies of the various web services of data-discovery (RARe or WheatIS apps).

The request and response bodies are always JSON. The examples showed here are pretty-printed to make them easier
to read, but they're not in reality. If you're using the services with the command-line, using HTTPie instead
of curl allows automatically pretty-printing the returned JSON.

All examples here use HTTP, and use `localhost` as the server, 8080 as port and `/rare` as the context path.
To use the actual deployed web services, you must of course use the actual protocol, host name, port and context path.

Some headers are also removed from the snippets here, to improve readability.

== Documents (aka Search)

=== Full text search

The documents endpoint is used to search documents.
The simplest way to use this service is to provide a query, that will be used to do a full-text search in the
various properties (except identifiers, numeric fields and URLs) of all the genetic resources.

=== Pagination

As you can see, you actually get back a page of results. The above example shows a search that would find only 2
matching documents. In reality, most searches will find much more matching documents than that, and you might thus want to navigate to a different page.

Suppose the previous search gets back a page where `totalPages` is 254.
You can request any page between 0 and 253 included by passing the page number as an additional request parameter.
If you omit the page parameter, the requested page is 0.

.Response

=== Highlighting

By passing an additional `highlight=true` request parameter, you can ask the search results to be highlighted.
To be accurate, only the description of the returned documents will be highlighted, by surrounding the matching
words between `<em></em>` HTML tags.

=== Aggregations

In addition to the page of documents, the service can also aggregate the search results.
To request the aggregations, you must pass an additional `aggregate=true` request parameter.
The set of properties used to compute aggregations is hard-coded on the server, and is thus always the same:
`domain`, `biotopeType`, `materialType`, `countryOfOrigin` and `taxon`.

If you request aggregations, then for each property, an aggregation will be computed and the results will contain
every distinct value of the property along with the number of matching documents for each distinct value.

=== Filtering

Based on the aggregations obtained when searching, you can execute the same search query, but filter the results
by choosing one or several values for every aggregation.

For example, if you want only the search results which have _France_ **or** _Italy_ as their country of origin,
you can pass the following additional request parameters: `coo=France&coo=Italy`.

If you want only the search results which have _France_ **or** _Italy_ as their country of origin, *and* _Plantae_
as their domain, you can pass the following additional request parameters: `coo=France&coo=Italy&domain=Plantae`.

NOTE: These additional filters are applied *after* the full-text search.
This means that they will not be highlighted in the description, and more importantly, it means that if you combine
filters with aggregation (i.e. `aggregate=true`), the aggregations will be computed *before* the filters are applied.
This is necessary, otherwise there wouldn't be any other value then _Plantae_ in the returned aggregations, and
any other country than _France_ and _Italy_, which would prevent you from knowing which additional filters you
can apply to further refine the query.

== Pillars

=== List pillars

The pillars service is used to list pillars, their database sources, and the number of documents existing for each of them in the database.

.Curl
include::{snippets}/pillars/list/curl-request.adoc[]

.Response

.Response fields

== Suggestions

=== List suggestions

The suggestions service is used to implement the _typeahead_ functionality of the search input field. Based on what the user has typed, the service is called to get completion suggestions.

The number of distinct suggested completions is limited to 10.
