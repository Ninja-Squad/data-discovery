== Introduction

This document describes the URLs, parameters, request and response bodies of the various web services of RARe.

The request and response bodies are always JSON. The examples showed here are pretty-printed to make them easier
to read, but they're not in reality. If you're using the services with the command-line, using HTTPie instead
of curl allows automatically pretty-printing the returned JSON.

All examples here use HTTP, and show example with `localhost` as the server, and 8080 as port. To use the
actual deployed web services, you must of course use the actual protocol, host name and port.

Some headers are also removed from the snippets here, to improve readability.

== Harvests

=== Trigger a harvest

Harvesting, i.e. importing resources from JSON files into Elasticsearch, is simply done by copying the JSON
files to the configured `rare.resource-dir` directory, and then sending a POST request, without any body,
to trigger the harvest.

Harvested resources which already exist are updated (they are identified by their `identifier` property).

Note that, to avoid letting anyone trigger a harvest, the endpoints are secured using basic authentication. The
user and the password are configured in the Spring configuration. The following snippets assume the user is
`rare`, and the password is `f01a7031fc17`. If you don't provide the authentication information, or if it's incorrect
you'll get back a response with the status `401 Unauthorized`.

.Curl

.HTTPie
include::{snippets}/harvests/post/httpie-request.adoc[]

The response is immediate: the harvesting job is executed asynchronously. It only contains a Location header
containing the URL of the endpoint that you can query to know the status of the harvest. Each triggered harvest
has a unique auto-generated ID, found at the end of the URL.

.Response
include::{snippets}/harvests/post/http-response.adoc[]

=== Get a harvest

You can get a harvest to know if the harvest is finished or not, and to know which files have already been harvested,
and which errors occurred during the harvest. The report is pretty detailed, and tries its best to provide indices,
line and colum numbers as well as error messages allowing to identify what and where the errors are.

Note that files are processed sequentially, and that resources are parsed one by one, using a the Jackson streaming
parser. This allows harvesting enormous files if needed without fearing any memory problem. It also allows
parsing a file even if one of its resources has an error and thus can't be parsed correctly.

=== List harvests

If you lost or forgot the URL of the harvest you have triggered, and want to see how it went, don't panic. You can
send a GET request to list the last 10 harvests that have been triggered.

.Request
include::{snippets}/harvests/list/http-request.adoc[]

.Curl
include::{snippets}/harvests/list/curl-request.adoc[]

.Response
include::{snippets}/harvests/list/http-response.adoc[]

.Response fields
include::{snippets}/harvests/list/response-fields.adoc[]

As you can see, you actually get back a page of results. In the unlikely case you want to know about old harvests,
you can request other pages than the latest one by passing the page as request parameter:

== Genetic Resources (aka Search)

=== Full text search

The genetic resources endpoint is used to search for genetic resources.
The simplest way to use this service is to provide a query, that will be used to do a full-text search in the
various properties (except identifiers, numeric fields and URLs) of all the genetic resources.

.Request
include::{snippets}/search/fulltext/http-request.adoc[]

.Request parameters
include::{snippets}/search/fulltext/request-parameters.adoc[]

.Curl
include::{snippets}/search/fulltext/curl-request.adoc[]

.HTTPie
include::{snippets}/search/fulltext/httpie-request.adoc[]

.Response
include::{snippets}/search/fulltext/http-response.adoc[]

.Response fields
include::{snippets}/search/fulltext/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Pagination

As you can see, you actually get back a page of results. The above example shows a search that would find only 2
matching genetic resources. In reality, most searches will find much more matching resources than that, and you might thus want to navigate to a different page.

Suppose the previous search gets back a page where `totalPages` is 254.
You can request any page between 0 and 253 included by passing the page number as an additional request parameter.
If you omit the page parameter, the requested page is 0.

.Request
include::{snippets}/search/page/http-request.adoc[]

.Request parameters
include::{snippets}/search/page/request-parameters.adoc[]

.Curl
include::{snippets}/search/page/curl-request.adoc[]

.HTTPie
include::{snippets}/search/page/httpie-request.adoc[]

.Response
include::{snippets}/search/page/http-response.adoc[]

=== Highlighting

By passing an additional `highlight=true` request parameter, you can ask the search results to be highlighted.
To be accurate, only the description of the returned genetic resources will be highlighted, by surrounding the matching
words between `<em></em>` HTML tags.

.Request
include::{snippets}/search/highlight/http-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/search/highlight/request-parameters.adoc[]

.Curl
include::{snippets}/search/highlight/curl-request.adoc[]

.HTTPie
include::{snippets}/search/highlight/httpie-request.adoc[]

.Response
include::{snippets}/search/highlight/http-response.adoc[]

=== Aggregations

In addition to the page of genetic resources, the service can also aggregate the search results.
To request the aggregations, you must pass an additional `aggregate=true` request parameter.
The set of properties used to compute aggregations is hard-coded on the server, and is thus always the same:
`domain`, `biotopeType`, `materialType`, `countryOfOrigin` and `taxon`.

If you request aggregations, then for each property, an aggregation will be computed and the results will contain
every distinct value of the property along with the number of matching documents for each distinct value.

.Request
include::{snippets}/search/aggregate/http-request.adoc[]

.Request parameters
include::{snippets}/search/aggregate/request-parameters.adoc[]

.Curl
include::{snippets}/search/aggregate/curl-request.adoc[]

.HTTPie
include::{snippets}/search/aggregate/httpie-request.adoc[]

.Response
include::{snippets}/search/aggregate/http-response.adoc[]

.Response fields
include::{snippets}/search/aggregate/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Filtering

Based on the aggregations obtained when searching, you can execute the same search query, but filter the results
by choosing one or several values for every aggregation.

For example, if you want only the search results which have _France_ **or** _Italy_ as their country of origin,
you can pass the following additional request parameters: `coo=France&coo=Italy`.

If you want only the search results which have _France_ **or** _Italy_ as their country of origin, *and* _Plantae_
as their domain, you can pass the following additional request parameters: `coo=France&coo=Italy&domain=Plantae`.

NOTE: These additional filters are applied *after* the full-text search.
This means that they will not be highlighted in the description, and more importantly, it means that if you combine
filters with aggregation (i.e. `aggregate=true`), the aggregations will be computed *before* the filters are applied.
This is necessary, otherwise there wouldn't be any other value then _Plantae_ in the returned aggregations, and
any other country than _France_ and _Italy_, which would prevent you from knowing which additional filters you
can apply to further refine the query.

== Pillars

=== List pillars

The pillars service is used to list pillars, their database sources, and the number of genetic resources existing for each of them in the database.

.Request

.Curl
include::{snippets}/pillars/list/curl-request.adoc[]

== Suggestions

=== List suggestions

The suggestions service is used to implement the _typeahead_ functionality of the search input field. Based on what the user has typed, the service is called to get completion suggestions.

The number of distinct suggested completions is limited to 10.
