# About this web portal

The purpose of this web portal is to facilitate the discoverability of public data on plant biology
managed by different laboratories accross the world.

Initiated within **[transPLANT](http://transplantdb.eu/)** (EC FP7, contract number `283496`), **[WheatIS](www.wheatis.org)**
(expert working group of the [Wheat Initiative](https://www.wheatinitiative.org/)) then **[Elixir-fr/IFB](https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/en/elixir-fr)** (ANR, contract number `11-INBS-0013`) projects & collaborations, we are
now able to index and make findable data from any species of any kind of data.

If you want your information system to be referenced, you have to provide [TSV](#tsv-tabulation-separated-values) or [JSON](#json-javascript-object-notation) files with metadata only.
The metadata format must folow the indications below and we invite you to [contact us](mailto:urgi-contact@inra.fr?subject=%5BWheatIS%2FData%20Discovery%5D)
as soon as possible so that we can provide help and discuss the best way to go ahead.

Note that since the tool makes a backlink to your information system, we need a URL allowing researchers
to get more detailed information about the indexed entry directly in your information system.
