## Perspectives 2021

### Monitor outgoing traffic towards partner databases

This metric will trace the impact of the RARe data portal, hence promoting its use.

### Search by synonyms

Search by taxon now uses synonyms from 2 data sources: [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) and [GnpIS](https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/siregal/common/taxon/results.do?thematic=all). Any search term matching a known taxon name also searches its synonyms. Matching synonyms are highlighted in the results to inform the user of the process.

### Display date of last data update

Make the data loading process smoothier and display the date of the last data update in the web interface.

## Long term perspectives

### Allow search for exact phrases

Allow searching group of terms linked together, ie. "_fusarium head blight_". Currently, any of the 3 terms are searched independently, resulting in a lot of false positives.

### Review the storage of data

Currently the data is stored next to the code into Git LFS. We plan to review this approach to reduce the storage cost.

### Download results

Add a download feature allowing to get batch results in a tabulated and/or JSON format. Number of results to be clarified.
