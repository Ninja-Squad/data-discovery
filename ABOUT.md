# About this web portal

The purpose of this web portal is to facilitate the discoverability of public data on plant biology managed by different laboratories across the world.

It has been initiated as a pilot project allowing to find data across several distinct databases based on a common high level generic data model (Spannagl et al. 2016).
The development was made within [**transPLANT**](http://transplantdb.eu/) (EC FP7, contract number `283496`), [**WheatIS**](www.wheatis.org) (expert working group of the [Wheat Initiative](https://www.wheatinitiative.org/)) then [**Elixir-fr/IFB**](https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/en/elixir-fr) (ANR, contract number `11-INBS-0013`) projects & collaborations.
Then it has been upgraded with the help of [Ninja Squad](https://ninja-squad.com/) team using up-to-date technologies, improved code and packaging in the frame of the federation of French biological resources centers [**AgroBRC-Rare**](https://www.agrobrc-rare.org).

We are now able to index and make findable any kind of data from any species.
If you want your information system to be referenced, please, read the appropriate HOW-TO-JOIN section.
