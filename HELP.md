You can search for data by entering one or several term(s) in the main search box.

You are guided when you begin to type, a list of relevant suggestions is proposed.

If you enter several terms, document having both of them will be ranked higher.

You can then filter using the facet on the left side (or on top on small devices) to refine your search.

If some of the categories are too large, then you're given the possibility to search for specific term in those categories.
