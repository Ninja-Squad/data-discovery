You can seek data by entering one or several term(s) in the main search box (_e.g._ **wheat yield** or **Vitis**). 
> Note: there is no boolean operator neither quote character allowing to refine your query, any entered term will be used to find data. 

A list of relevant suggestions is proposed when you begin to type your keywords to guide you in your search.
You can select one of those suggestions or decide to ignore them all and type your own term, in this latter case it is possible that you get no result at all.

The query is launched by hitting the `Enter` key of your keyboard or by clicking on the `Search` button.
If several terms were searched for, documents having all of them will be ranked higher on the result page.

You can then filter this list of results by using the facets/categories on the left side to refine your search.
When categories allowing filtering are too large (_i.e._ they contain more than 10 elements), they appear as search box in which you can chose among available terms.
> Note: applying several filters in the same facet/category will search for documents related to any of the selected terms (resulting in a `OR` operator between all the category's terms).
> In contrary, applying filters in different facets/categories will search for documents having both filters (resulting in an `AND` operator for the different facets).
