You can seek data by entering one or several term(s) in the main search box (eg. wheat yield, vitis).
A list of relevant suggestions is proposed when you begin to type to guided you in your search.
You can select one of those suggestions or decide to ignore them all and type your own term.

The query is launch by hiting the `Search` button or the `Enter` key of your keyboard.
If several terms were searched, document having all of them will be ranked higher on the result page.

You can then add one or several filter(s) by using the facets/categories on the left side (or on top on small devices) to refine your search.
When categories are too large (ie. they contain more than 10 elements), they appear as search box.
To use them, you just have to select the desired category and chose available term(s).
Note that applying several filters in the same facet will add `OR` restrictions, but applying several filters in different facets will add `AND` restrictions.
