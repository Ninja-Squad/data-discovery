   # even if that would be ideal
   # we can't just launch the service with just elasticsearch:6.3.1
   # because we need to pass some variables, but they are passed to _all_ containers
   # so they fail the start of other docker images like ninjasquad/docker-rare
   # the only solution is to override the entrypoint of the service and pass the arguments manually
